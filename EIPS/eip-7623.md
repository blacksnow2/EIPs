## Abstract

The current calldata pricing allows for significantly large blocks of up to 2.8 MB while the average block size is much smaller at 125 KB. 
This EIP proposes an adjustment in the Ethereum calldata price to reduce the current maximum block size and its variance. 
This is achieved through adjusting calldata pricing, aligning with emerging data storage practices in the network, especially in the context of [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md).


## Motivation

The block gas limit has not been increased since [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md), while the average size of blocks has continuously increased due to the growing number of rollups posting data to Ethereum. 
[EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) introduces blobs as a preferred method for data availability, signaling a shift away from calldata-dependent strategies. 
This transition demands a reevaluation of calldata pricing, especially with regards to mitigating the inefficiency between the average block size in bytes and the maximum one possible.
By increasing the gas cost for nonzero calldata bytes for transactions that are mainly using Ethereum for Data Availability (DA), the proposal aims to balance the need for block space with the necessity of reducing the maximum block size to make room for adding more blobs. The move from using calldata for DA to blobs further strengthens the multidimensional fee market by incentivizing blob space.


## Specification

| Parameter | Value |
| - | - |
| `STANDARD_TOKEN_COST`    |  `4` |
| `TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN`    |  `17` |


Let `tokens_in_calldata = zero_bytes_in_calldata + nonzero_bytes_in_calldata * 4`.


The current formula for determining the gas used per transaction, typically described as `nonzero_bytes_in_calldata * 16 + zero_bytes_in_calldata * 4`, is equivalent to:

```python
tx.gasused = (
    21000 +
    STANDARD_TOKEN_COST * tokens_in_calldata +
    evm_gas_used
)
```

The formula for determining the gas used per transaction changes to:

```python
tx.gasused = (
    21000 +
    max(
        TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN * tokens_in_calldata, 
        STANDARD_TOKEN_COST * tokens_in_calldata + evm_gas_used
    )
)
```

## Rationale

The current maximum block size is approximately 1.79 MB (`30_000_000/16`). One can create blocks full of zero bytes that go up to 7.5 MB, but it is now standard to wrap blocks with snappy compression at the p2p layer and so such zero-byte-heavy blocks would end up smaller than 1.79 MB in practice. With the implementation of [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) this will increase to about 2.54 MB.
This proposal aims to increase the cost of calldata to 68 gas for transactions that do not exceed a certain threshold of gas spent on EVM operations. This change will significantly reduce the maximum block size by limiting the number and size of pure-data transactions that can fit into a single block. Specifically, by adjusting the price of nonzero calldata bytes to 68 gas for DA transactions, the goal is to lower the maximum block size to roughly 0.55 MB.


This reduction makes room for increasing the block gas limit or the number of blobs, while ensuring network security and efficiency. 
Importantly, regular users (sending ETH/tokens/NFTs, engaging in DeFi, social media, restaking, etc.) who do not use Ethereum exclusively for DA, may remain unaffected.
The calldata price for transactions involving significant EVM computation remains at 16 gas per nonzero byte, ensuring these users experience no change. This strategy protects users reliant on heavy calldata alongside EVM computations, ensuring they are not negatively impacted by the revised pricing structure.


## Backwards Compatibility

This is a backwards incompatible gas repricing that requires a scheduled network upgrade.

Users will be able to continue operating with no changes.

## Security Considerations

As the maximum possible block size is reduced, no security concerns were raised.
